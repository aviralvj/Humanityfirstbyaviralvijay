## First Intuition

Strong Intuitions - we don't alive by breathing oxygen. we breathe in the same way earth is created like we breath Nitrogen which helps us alive. 

Nitrogen is nature's vitamin E or Praana Vayu in Ayurveda wider the nerves in our body which most need in brain to function properly. In Ayurveda, Its clearly mentioned as Vayu which in one of the Panch Tatva.

Those who stays once in a while in Pune or Bangalore knows that how weather feels there because there is no need to do anything extra to breathe. It feels better when body got wider nerves by Nitrogen.

All Indian food based on four things Namak(Iodine-Vitamin B6) Mirch(Vitamin A) Haldi(Vitamin E) Dhaniya(Vitamin C) which is key to help when having all four plus food means either Iron or Vitamin D, All the body health needs done.

Where there is cold like northern area in earth there is higher Vitamin E (Nitrogen) with pressure already present therefore they don't need either high amount of vitamin A or vitamin E all they need is Vitamin B6 and Vitamin C and Iron or Vitamin D and very less Vitamin A which is usually present in Namak (Sodium Chloride +Iodine).

Where there is hot like middle east and Indian area there is less Vitamin E (Nitrogen) with less pressure available therefore either they need more high breathe like by mouth or have four vitamins like A,B6,C,E. Yoga or religious practice does same, does more breath which reaches in Brain easier.

Heat means less pressure Nitrogen and Cold means high pressure Nitrogen therefore only in AC liquid Nitrogen is filled and deep refrigerators also.

Sanghnitra Sidhant does the same in some manner to cool down the temperature in hot areas.

Ayurveda is Key. If world live with Ayurveda then Consider Sarve Santu Niramaya Implemented. Completely Open Source free No copy right.


When we are in flight for longer time some of us feels breathing issue on that time if we drink water instead of oxygen mask (nitrogen) then also we feels better I have done it once because Water also dilute the blood which flow ease in brain.

What a coincident, Silk route exists in the places where whether is either hot or moderate which makes it eligible for all four vitamins need A,B6,C,E and Iron or Vitamin D where cold places actually don't need all only B6,C,D needed.

In Current Medical Science also, Doctors does not guarantee for disease recovery while with the same medicine some patients recover and some not and some recover by delay some time AND In Ayurveda also, Disease is consider as punishment to soul by Almighty where Soul itself is sub-part of almighty therefore with the same medicine some recover and some not and some recover later.

All it needs is to do attempt to recover all at least so that sooner or later people will become disease free for better world that's why Sarve Santu Niramaya is a prayer to almighty which means we request the almighty to allow us to do so.
